# PeriFast

## PeriFast/Corrosion

**PeriFast/Corrosion**, a MATLAB code that uses the fast convolution-based method (FCBM) for peridynamic (PD) models of corrosion damage.The code efficiently solves 3D uniform corrosion (in copper) and pitting corrosion (in stainless steel) problems with multiple growing and merging pits, set in a complicated shape sample.

Detailed description of the PeriFast/Corrosion Code can be found in [PeriFast/Corrosion: a 3D pseudo-spectral peridynamic code for corrosion](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2046856/v1)

## PeriFast/Dynamics

**PeriFast/Dynamics**, a compact and user-friendly MATLAB code for fast peridynamic (PD) simulations for deformation and fracture. PeriFast/Dynamics uses the fast convolution-based method (FCBM) for spatial discretization and an explicit time marching scheme to solve large-scale dynamic fracture problems.
